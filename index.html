<p>Welcome to <strong>the cloudyr project</strong>! The goal of this initiative is to make cloud computing with R easier, starting with robust tools for working with Amazon Web Services.</p>

<p>The motivation for the project is simple: cloud computing is a critical component of contemporary software development and data analysis. The reasons for this are numerous (e.g., speed, memory, storage capacity, parallel computing, etc.) and need not be rehashed here. Yet R does not currently have many tools for engaging in cloud computing. There are many tools for extracting data from the cloud (see <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/WebTechnologies.html">the Web Technologies Task View</a>), but there are not very many tools for connecting a local R instance to cloud-based services.</p>

<p>This is unfortunate given the growing popularity of R and the fact that AWS (and other cloud providers) often make software development kits available for numerous languages (such as Java, Python, Ruby, etc.). R is currently underserved in the realm of cloud computing and the goal of the cloudyr project is to make cloud computing faster, easier, and more intuitive for R users.</p>

<p>Indeed, the project's motto is simple: "Make R Cloudier!"</p>
